Steps to Host Your XAMPP Website Publicly Using localhost.run:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.

2. Start the OpenSSH Agent:
   Start-Service ssh-agent

3. Check if the SSH Agent is running:
   Get-Service -Name ssh-agent

4. Add your SSH key to the SSH Agent:
   ssh-add C:\\Users\\jasha\\.ssh\\id_ed25519

5. Run the SSH command to create a tunnel:
   ssh -R 80:localhost:80 ssh.localhost.run

6. Once the command runs, you will see a public URL like:
 My Liks will shown like this ".lhr.life".

7. Open the provided URL in a browser to access your website.

Notes:
- Keep the PowerShell window open to maintain the tunnel. Closing the window will stop the tunnel and the public URL will expire.
- If you need a more permanent URL, visit localhost.run documentation to set up an account and configure a custom domain.
